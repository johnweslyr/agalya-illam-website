# Agalya Illam — Static Website Starter

This is a simple, multi-page static site powered by Tailwind (via Play CDN) and vanilla JS.
Perfect for beginners. Deploy to Netlify or Vercel in minutes.

## How to use (quick)
1. Extract the zip.
2. Open the folder in VS Code.
3. Right-click `index.html` and choose "Open with Live Server" (install the Live Server extension).
4. Edit any `.html` content to match your details (email, phone, address, payment links, etc.).
5. Push to GitHub (optional) and deploy on Netlify or Vercel.

## Netlify forms
The contact and newsletter forms have `data-netlify="true"` so submissions will work on Netlify with no backend.
Enable forms in your Netlify dashboard after first deploy.

## Replace placeholders
- Payment buttons on `support.html` → paste your real PayPal/Stripe buttons/links.
- Bank/UPI details → update text and add your QR image under `assets/img/` and replace the placeholder box.
- Address/Map → put your real address and replace the map placeholder with a Google Maps embed.
